# PNRGatewayClient
 The component of PNRGateway that runs on the Android phone and talks to the Apple registration number.
 
 **Note: If you're compiling this yourself, make sure to fill in your carrier's gateway address and your iPhone's phone number (both in international format) in the constant fields at the top of `PDUReceiver.java`**
 
 I made a whole write-up on how the process works over on the [PNRGatewayTweak](https://github.com/AwesomeIndustry/PNRGatewayTweak) repo, so go check it out!
