# PNRGatewayClient
 The component of PNRGateway that runs on the Android phone and talks to the Apple registration number.
 
 **Note: If you're running this, make sure to give the app SMS permissions and set the iPhone number and gateway address in the app settings!**
 
 I made a whole write-up on how the process works over on the [PNRGatewayTweak](https://github.com/AwesomeIndustry/PNRGatewayTweak) repo, so go check it out!
